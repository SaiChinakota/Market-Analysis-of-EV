## Data Analytics and Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository, a collection of projects showcasing my work in data analytics and machine learning. This repository contains various projects that highlight my skills in data processing, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. Below is an overview of the key projects included:

### Projects
1. Customer Churn Prediction
Predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

2. Fake News Detection
Building a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real. The project involves natural language processing (NLP) for text data preprocessing and feature extraction, followed by model training and evaluation. Tools used: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

3. Heart Disease Risk Assessment
Developing a predictive model to assess the risk of heart disease based on patient data. This project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model evaluation. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

4. Synthetic Flight Track Generation
Generating synthetic flight tracks using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). This project includes data preprocessing, model training with ground speed and range constraints, and visualization of synthetic tracks. Tools used: Python, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.

5. Sales Data Analysis
Analyzing sales data to identify trends and business opportunities. The project involves data cleaning, EDA, and visualization. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Power BI.

6. Financial Data Feeds Development
Developing financial data feeds and performing data visualization using Tableau. This project includes data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, followed by dashboard creation in Tableau. Tools used: Python, SQL, and Tableau.
